Use this service plugin to easily activate any of our products, open a support ticket and view documentation all from your wp-admin!

== Description ==

To take full advantage of this plugin you should have one of our plugins installed.

[GeoDirectory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/geodirectory/) | [UsersWP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/userswp/) | [GetPaid](https://wordpress.org/plugins/invoicing/) | [BlockStrap](https://wordpress.org/plugins/blockstrap-page-builder-blocks/)

AyeCode Connect is a service plugin, meaning that it will have no functionality until you connect your site to ours. This link allows us to provide extra services to your site such as live documentation search and submission of support tickets.
After connecting your site you can install our update plugin which will give you the ability to automatically sync license keys of purchases and also be able to remotely install and update purchased products.

You will be able to remotely manage your activated sites and licences all from your account area on our site.

You can also use our one click demo importer.

NEW: Cloudflare Turnstile Captcha feature.  You can now activate Cloudflare turnstile on your site which will add a captcha to all AyeCode Ltd products ( GeoDirectory, UsersWP, GetPaid, BlockStrap ).
Our implementation of Turnstile is loaded only when the field is show on the screen which helps with speed and SEO of your site.
NOTE: Your site does NOT have to be using Cloudflare to be able to use Cloudflare Turnstile.
